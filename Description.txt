- **Description**: Briefly describe the purpose and functionality of `@[app2]`.

## Setup and Installation
To prepare the applications for use, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the Application Directory**:
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Change to the application directory using the command:
     ```bash
     cd c:/laragon/www/PROJECTFINALS/MESSAGE-120(GIT)/TESTINGPHASE/Experiment/app1  # For app1
     cd c:/laragon/www/PROJECTFINALS/MESSAGE-120(GIT)/TESTINGPHASE/Experiment/app2  # For app2
     ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Ensure you have Python and pip installed.
   - Install the required dependencies by running:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt

## Running the Applications
To start the applications, execute the following commands:

1. **For `@[app1]`**:
   ```bash
   cd c:/laragon/www/PROJECTFINALS/MESSAGE-120(GIT)/TESTINGPHASE/Experiment/app1
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

2. **For `@[app2]`**:
   ```bash
   cd c:/laragon/www/PROJECTFINALS/MESSAGE-120(GIT)/TESTINGPHASE/Experiment/app2
   python manage.py runserver 8002
   ```

## Accessing the Applications
- Once the applications are running, open your web browser and navigate to:
  - `http://localhost:8000` for `@[app1]`
  - `http://localhost:8002` for `@[app2]`


"Wait for App2 to load, or refresh it to ensure the login is applied. Due to some slow configurations in the background, it may take some time to fully load."
